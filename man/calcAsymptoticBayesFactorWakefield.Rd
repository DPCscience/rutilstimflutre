\title{Asymptotic Bayes factor}
\usage{
calcAsymptoticBayesFactorWakefield(theta.hat, V, W, weights = NULL,
  log10 = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{theta.hat}{vector of MLE(s) of the additive genetic effect(s)}

\item{V}{vector of the corresponding variance(s) of \code{theta.hat}}

\item{W}{vector of variance(s) of the prior on theta (if several values, the ABF will be averaged over them)}

\item{weights}{weights used to average over the grid of \code{W} (all equal by default)}

\item{log10}{return the log10 of the ABF}
}
\value{
numeric
}
\description{
Calculate the asymptotic Bayes factor proposed by Wakefield in Genetic Epidemiology 33:79-86 (2009, \url{http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/gepi.20359}).
Can also be averaged over a grid of values of W, as done in various papers from Matthew Stephens' lab.
